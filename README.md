# video-game-algo

This project aims to create an 8-bit medieval style RPG dungeon crawler primarily using the Python game development module library pygame.
This game will include multiple stages, enemies, bosses, and items using algorithms.


Prior to installation: install pygame (and of course python)

Python download: https://www.python.org/downloads/ (for Windows users, make sure to check Add to PATH in installation if it pops up)

Pygame: in the command line, run: python -m pip install -U pygame --user (if this doesn't run then try python3 instead of python)
